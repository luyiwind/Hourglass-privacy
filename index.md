# Privacy Policy for Hourglass

**Last updated: February 07, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how **Hourglass** ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information Collection and Use

We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, address, or phone number directly. However, the App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

### Third-Party Service Providers
We use the following third-party services which may collect data:

*   **Google AdMob**: Used to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use your device's **Advertising ID** to serve personalized ads.
*   **RevenueCat**: Used to manage in-app subscriptions and theme purchases. RevenueCat collects an anonymous **App User ID** to track your purchase status and provide features like "New User Rewards" (ad-free duration). It helps us ensure your purchases are available across your devices.

*   [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)

## 2. App Permissions

The App requires specific permissions to function correctly:

*   **FOREGROUND_SERVICE (Media Playback)**: Required to keep the timer running and play the alarm sound even when the app is in the background or the screen is locked.
*   **USE_EXACT_ALARM & SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM**: Required to ensure the timer finishes at the exact precise moment you set.
*   **POST_NOTIFICATIONS**: Required to show the timer progress and the "Time's up" alert in the notification bar.
*   **USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT**: Required to show the full-screen alarm interface when the timer finishes while your device is locked.
*   **INTERNET / ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE**: Required for downloading themes, validating purchases (via RevenueCat), and displaying advertisements.
*   **REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS**: Required to ensure the timer continues to run accurately in the background, preventing the system from killing the app process during long timing sessions.

## 3. Data Safety (Google Play)

*   **Data Shared**: Yes (Device IDs for Advertising and Purchase Management).
*   **Data Collected**:
